        <h1>This is a fucking portfolio.</h1>
        <aside>And it's refreshingly honest.</aside>

    <h2>Seriously, what the hell else do you need?</h2>
        
    <p>You probably visit portfolios with spinning 3D models and parallax everything. You think those 50MB animations showing someone's "coding journey" are impressive. You think loading 40 different fonts and 200 JavaScript libraries makes a portfolio "interactive." Meanwhile, I'm over here building tools that actually matter - like helping people escape financial surveillance and government money printing. Wrong priorities, motherfucker. Let me show you what a real cypherpunk portfolio looks like:</p>
        
    <ul>
        <li>Loads faster than your attention span (and faster than government censorship)</li>
        <li>Works on every device from iPhone to Gentoo-booted Thinkpad</li>
        <li>Actually tells you what I do instead of making you solve cryptographic puzzles (sometimes I like to create puzzles tho)</li>
        <li>Doesn't phone home to 47 different tracking services</li>
        <li>Gets to the fucking point without requiring JavaScript enabled</li>
    </ul>
        
    <h3>I'm jaonoctus, and I build shit that actually matters.</h3>
        
    <p>I'm a Backend Engineer at <strong>ZBD</strong>, where I wrangle Bitcoin and Lightning Network code that actually moves real money without asking permission from some suit at a bank. You might need to KYC tho, not my rules you stupid fuck. Before that, I've been breaking and fixing things in the crypto space since I was a fucking kid, back when "web3" wasn't a marketing buzzword and we actually cared about decentralization.</p>

    <h2>Projects I Actually Built</h2>
        
    <p>Here's some stuff I made that actually works, unlike those concept portfolios with lorem ipsum text:</p>
        
    <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://bitcalc.jaonoctus.dev/" target="_blank">BitCalc</a></strong> - A bitcoin price calculator that doesn't require 40 APIs and a machine learning model to tell you what 1 BTC costs.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="http://bitcoin-snapshots.jaonoctus.dev/" target="_blank">Bitcoin Snapshots</a></strong> - Assume UTXO and folder snapshots of all networks of bitcoin. For when you want to sync faster than a Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://nip06.jaonoctus.dev/" target="_blank">NIP06</a></strong> - A Nostr Key derivation from mnemonic seed phrase. Because one more standard never hurt anyone... right?</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://nums-secp256k1.jaonoctus.dev/" target="_blank">Secp256k1 NUMS generator</a></strong> - Generates cryptographically secure random unspendable Public Keys. It's math, deal with it.</li>
    </ul>
        
    <h2>What I actually do</h2>
        
    <p><strong>ZBD</strong><br>
    Backend Engineer | May 2024 - Present<br>
    <small>C#, Node.js, Bitcoin, Lightning Network</small><br>
    Building payment infrastructure that doesn't lose people's money. Revolutionary concept, I know.</p>

    <p><strong>VinteUm</strong><br>
    Developer Advocate | Present<br>
    Being a teacher without a bachelor's degree - educating developers about Bitcoin while the academics are still figuring out what a blockchain is.</p>

    <p><strong>NOCTUS LTDA</strong><br>
    CEO | 2014 - Present<br>
    My own company where I get to be the boss and the only employee who shows up to meetings.</p>

    <p><strong>Comet Cash</strong><br>
    Technical Lead | Jul 2023 - Apr 2024<br>
    <small>Technology Leadership, LDK, LND, React Native, Node.js, C#</small><br>
    Led a team and actually shipped products while the CEOs were busy being "led by AI" without understanding what the fuck AI actually does. Shocking, I know.</p>

    <p><strong>Kraken</strong><br>
    Software Engineer | Jul 2021 - Nov 2022<br>
    <small>Blockchain, Git, Bash</small><br>
    Worked at an actual crypto exchange where uptime matters more than your feelings.</p>

    <p><strong>BlueWallet</strong><br>
    Open Source Developer | Apr 2021 - Sep 2021<br>
    <small>React Native, Lightning, JavaScript, Bitcoin</small><br>
    Contributed to open source because apparently I enjoy working for free sometimes.</p>

    <p><strong>Manycontent</strong><br>
    Full Stack Engineer | Apr 2018 - Apr 2021<br>
    <small>Vue.js, Node.js, Firebase, TypeScript, Jest</small><br>
    Built web applications that people actually used instead of just pretty demos.</p>

    <p><strong>Crowdster</strong><br>
    Full Stack Engineer | Jan 2020 - Feb 2021<br>
    <small>Vue.js, Kubernetes, AdonisJs, HTML5 Canvas, PostgreSQL, React.js, Docker</small><br>
    Contracted because apparently I wasn't busy enough with my full-time job.</p>

    <p><strong>App2Sales</strong><br>
    Full Stack Engineer | Mar 2017 - Jan 2018<br>
    <small>CSS, Laravel, Vue.js, MySQL, JavaScript, PHP, HTML</small><br>
    Back when I thought PHP was a good idea. We all make mistakes.</p>
        
    <h2>The bottom line</h2>
        
    <p>I solve problems with code. I don't make them worse with unnecessary complexity. If you need someone who can build robust backend systems, work with cryptocurrency infrastructure, or just get shit done without the drama, we should talk.</p>
        
    <p>No fancy animations. No mystery meat navigation. Just a developer who knows what they're doing and isn't afraid to say it.</p>
